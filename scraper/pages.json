This dynamic show is performed by eight professional actors and six talented students. The show runs 80 minutes, and each performance is followed by a talk-back discussion with the actors and audience.\nFall Mainstage\nAlice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass\nBy Sean Adams\nBased on the books by Lewis Carroll\nNovember 6 – 28\nDirected by Melissa Nicholson\nBored with rules and lessons, young Alice finds herself literally tumbling into an adventure after following a smartly-dressed white rabbit down a hole and into a topsy-turvy world, where up is down, left is right, and everything is what it isn&apos;t. Throughout her journeys, first in Wonderland and then in Looking-Glass Land, Alice meets a colorful cast of memorable characters in a tale that combines nursery rhymes, children&apos;s toys, and turns of phrase, turning each on their head with the dream-like logic of a child. Curiouser and curiouser!\nWinter Mainstage Partnership Production\nSankofa African American Theatre Company & Gamut Theatre present\nEchoes of Voices of the Eighth\nStories from Harrisburg&rsquo;s Old 8th Ward\nBy Sharia Benn\nFebruary 11 – 20\nDirected by Sharia Benn\nVoices of the Eighth\nis a journey that transcends time to connect two African American teens from the same Harrisburg neighborhood. This heartwarming story connects the young and old, past and present, and gone but not forgotten, to celebrate the history-making contributions of African Americans who lived in the Old Eighth Ward. Poetry and music infuse this original play in which Kay, a soon-to-graduate high schooler, finds her voice and value during an encounter with the past. On her journey, Kay meets Della who lived a much different life in the long-gone Eighth Ward. As different as the times they live in are, Kay and Della discover that they are connected in many ways.\nVoices of the Eighth\nis inspired by true stories and history-makers who lived between 1850 and 1920 in the rich and vibrant Old Eighth Ward, which was torn down to make way for the Capitol Complex we see today. During this journey from present to past and back again, Kay and Della meet some extraordinary abolitionists, activists, changemakers, and poets who were all instrumental in fighting for the freedom and rights we enjoy today: and they all came out of Harrisburg.\nSpring Mainstage\nOrlando\nBy Virginia Woolf\nAdapted by Sarah Ruhl\nMarch 12 - 27\nDirected by Francesca Amendolia\nOrlando, a young nobleman in the court of Queen Elizabeth I, yearns for love and adventure and to find his place in the world. So strong is his longing that he becomes untethered in time. Two hundred years of adventures and loves later, Orlando (who is now only thirty) awakes from a weeklong sleep to discover she has become a woman. Transformed and yet essentially the same person, Orlando still hungers for adventure and love and understanding. So has anything really changed?\nAdapted from the novel Virginia Woolf wrote for her lover Vita Sackville-West, Sarah Ruhl&rsquo;s\nOrlando\nis a hilarious, tender, and joyful celebration of queer love, gender, and the complicated and beautiful journey we all must take to discover our true selves.\nYoung Acting Company Partnership Production\nRasika School of Dance & Gamut Theatre present\nPanchatantra Tales\nBy Sean Adams\nBased on the popular folk tales from ancient India\nApril 8, 9, 10\nDirected by Rachita Menon and Melissa Nicholson\nAuditions: December 11 & 14\nA noble king in ancient India has three big problems: his children, the reckless and lazy royal princes. Fearing for the future of his people, the king consults with a wise guru, who agrees to teach the young princes through a series of animal stories and folk tales. These interwoven lessons form the basis of the Panchatantra (&quot;Five Treatises&quot;), one of the world&apos;s most popular collections of fables. Through wisdom, humor and dance, the princes learn about dharma - the duties and virtues expected from each of us - and the importance of being part of a bigger picture.\nFree Shakespeare in the Park\nThe Winter&apos;s Tale\nBy William Shakespeare\nJune 3 – 19\nDirected by Clark Nicholson\nAuditions: March 22 - 26, 2022\nThe Winter&apos;s Tale\nis a devastating tragedy, a light comedy, and an emotionally complex story. It&apos;s a reflection on mortality and a celebration of new life. Both terrifying and hilarious, it is a tale of magic and loss. In short, it&apos;s as filled with as many improbable and unpredictable shifts as is the average human life; especially the case when that life has been lived long enough. Written toward the tail end of Shakespeare&rsquo;s career, it&apos;s plain to see that it was crafted by a soul who had done a fair amount of living. Join us for our 29th Annual Free Shakespeare in the Park production this summer for\nThe Winter&apos;s Tale.\nAnd the irony of the title juxtaposed with the season we present it, we assure you, is fully intentional.

It closely looks at three chokepoints--a dinner in 2019, a street fight in 1943, and an impossible choice in 1915--where the inherent duality of the family&apos;s Latina/o experience is forced to be contended with. All of the stories told in the play are based on true historical events. The research into those events began with Zayas looking into his own family history and subsequently conducting personal interviews with over 30 people about their own family&apos;s experiences with language, identity, and race.\nGamut Signature Fall Play\nInnocent Merriment;\nOr, An Evening with Gilbert & Sullivan!\nNovember 5 - 27, 2022\nDirected by Benjamin Krumreig\nAuditions: August 13 & 14, 2022\nWinter Mainstage Partnership Production\nSankofa African American Theatre Company & Gamut Theatre\nFebruary 3 - 12, 2023\nGamut Spring Showcase\nPartnership with Narçisse Theatre Company\nRiders to the Sea\nand\nIn the Shadow of the Glen\nBy John Millington Synge\nMarch 4 - 19, 2023\nDirected by FL Henley Jr.\nAuditions: Nov. 30 - Dec. 2, 2022\nYoung Acting Company Partnership Production\nRasika School of Dance & Gamut Theatre present\nJungle Book\nBy Sean Adams\nMarch 31 - April 2, 2023\nDirected by Rachita Menon Nambiar and Melissa Nicholson\nDeep in the jungles of India, an infant &ldquo;man cub&rdquo; is adopted by a pack of wolves and raised as their own. The wolves name the baby Mowgli, who grows under the watchful eyes of Bagheera the panther and Baloo the sloth bear, who must train the child in the Laws of the Jungle. But not even their strict guidance can protect Mowgli from riotous monkeys, the vicious man-eating tiger Shere Khan, and the most fearsome animal of all - man. This much-beloved classic by Rudyard Kipling shows us the importance of family, respect for nature, and what it means to be human.\nShakespeare Educational Engagement\nMacbeth\nBy William Shakespeare\nApril 14 - 16, 2022\nDirected by Melissa Nicholson\n&ldquo;Something wicked this way comes…&rdquo;\nGamut Theatre, the combined theatre of Harrisburg Shakespeare Company and Popcorn Hat Players Children&rsquo;s Theatre, presents its highly acclaimed educational outreach production of\nMacbeth\n.  One of Shakespeare&rsquo;s most famous tragedies,\nMacbeth\nfollows the rise and fall of a Scottish lord-turned-King, whose ambition turns him into a brutal murderer consumed by the dark arts.  The play also explores the concept of fate vs. personal responsibility.\nRecommended for ages 12 and up, the production is extremely accessible, employing Gamut&rsquo;s unique educational outreach style of combining Shakespeare&rsquo;s original text with modern &ldquo;narrations&rdquo; to bridge the most famous scenes from the play together into an easy-to-understand story.

But this time, the writer has gone too far, and, well, Wiletta rebels against one more stereotypical role in a &ldquo;well-meaning race play.&rdquo;  The stakes are high, but this satire of backstage drama and racial tropes will make you both laugh and stop to think.\n#troubleinmindusf\nTrouble in Mind - Preview\nCalendar\nBuy Tickets\nFriday, June 24, 2022, 2:00 pm\nRandall L.

For those of you who have been with NYSX over the years, you know that Cristina has been an essential part of our growth. In addition to her numerous creative contributions, she has guided us behind the scenes in terms of all casting and hiring. She has been the single most important voice in creating a safe, equitable, and representative community. She has been my right hand, my left hand, and altogether her own force of creation.\nIn the almost two years since I moved out of New York, Cristina and I have had many conversations about the potential of this amazing organization. As Artistic Director, she will be working to make this her version of NYSX and I am truly excited to see what is to come.\nAnd you are not rid of me completely! I am planning to maintain my place on the Board of Directors, and whether she wants it or not, I will continue to be consultant, confidante, and dear friend to Cristina. For my own part, I will be taking some time to breathe and explore what comes next. My road as an artist has had many twists and turns, and no doubt, if I allow myself to stand at the crossroads for a bit, I will be drawn to the right adventure. The one thing I know for sure is that I will be doing a lot of singing as I go (if you are in Cleveland in June, come see me in my first opera!).\nBuilding New York Shakespeare Exchange has been a crowning glory of my life. Thank you for supporting me through the joy, laughter, art, and community.\nUntil our next exchange,\nRoss Williams\nFounder/Board of Directors\nA NOTE FROM OUR ARTISTIC DIRECTOR\nRoss Williams is a tough act to follow. He&rsquo;s an innovator at heart, and his knack for seeing the potential in undeveloped corners of artistic real estate is the reason NYSX has become known for putting Shakespeare on bar-tops and Sonnets on film. His &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; spirit has laid the foundation of this company, and it is the origin point of not only every project NYSX has ever brought to fruition, but also the culture of curiosity that makes me so proud to call this company my artistic home.\nThis curiosity is what drives me to seek a path forward for NYSX that might look very different from what the last 12 years have held. It drives me to look outside myself to members of our community – artists, to be sure, but also audience members – and ask, &ldquo;What has made your relationship to NYSX special? What would be missing in your life if we had never crossed paths? How can we be of service to our fellow artists and citizens with the work we do and the way we do it?&rdquo;\nI&rsquo;m excited to get to ask these questions of any of you who are open to the conversation. I hope to be surprised by some answers. And I look forward to the collaborations and creativity that will birth new projects and priorities for the company. I&rsquo;ve never been more excited to not know what comes next.\nWhat&rsquo;s past is prologue – let&rsquo;s raise a glass to it, and to our future.\nHuzzah!\nCristina Lundy\nPrograms\nTHE VOICES PROJECT\nCreation ~ Amplification ~ Conversation\nProductions\nInventive.
